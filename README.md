# Visualizing Earthquake Data
The files in this repo create a map of earthquake locations, depths, and magnitudes. The data is retrieved from the United States Geological Survey's GeoJSON Feed and will be current when the files in this repository are run.

## Directories and Files
`Leaflet-Step-1` - directory containing all files to produce the webpage with visualizations
* `static` - contains the `css` and `js` (javascript) files to style the webpage and produce the map
* `index.html` - file that produces the webpage to present the visualization

## To create this visualization:
1. Clone this repo to your computer
2. Navigate to `index.html` in the `Leaflet-Step-1` directory on your code editor
3. Open `index.html` on a live server to produce the visualization on a webpage
